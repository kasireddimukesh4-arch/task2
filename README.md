âœ… Step-by-Step Explanation 

ðŸ”¹ 1. HTML â€“ Structure of the Page

I am created the layout using basic HTML elements:

A heading to display the app title ("My To-Do List").

An input box where the user types a task.

An "Add" button to submit the task.

A list section where each added task appears.


I am also included the JavaScript and CSS files by linking them inside the HTML.

ðŸ”¹ 2. CSS â€“ Styling the Page



Background color and box shadow for a professional look.

The layout was centered and responsive using Flexbox.

The task items had their own card-like style with padding and spacing.

When a task is marked as completed, it becomes grey with a line through it.

Buttons change color when hovered to give feedback to the user.

ðŸ”¹ 3. JavaScript â€“ Functionality

JavaScript brought your app to life:

captured user input from the text box.

When the "Add" button is clicked:

It checks if the input is not empty.

Then it creates a new task item and adds it to the task list.


Each task item contains:

The task text

A "complete" button to mark it as done

A "delete" button to remove it


When the complete button is clicked:

The task gets a different style (like strikethrough).


When the delete button is clicked:

The task disappears from the list.

Your To-Do List app allows the user to:

Add new tasks

Mark tasks as done

Delete tasks
